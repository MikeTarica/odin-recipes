          <h3>COOKING INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
          <div class="cooking-Instruction-body-copy">
            <p>
              Preheat the oven to 200°C. Finely chop the onions, carrots and
              garlic in a food processor, then soften in the olive oil over a
              low heat for 5 minutes without allowing them to colour.
            </p>

            <p>
              Increase the heat to medium and add the mince. Brown, then add the
              thyme and red wine and cook for 1–2 minutes.
            </p>

            <p>
              Stir through the tomato purée, canned tomatoes, beef stock, tomato
              paste and season to taste. Simmer for 45 minutes to 1 hour, then
              stir through the balsamic vinegar.
            </p>

            <p>
              To make the white sauce, melt the butter in a pan over a low heat,
              then whisk in the flour and cook for 1 minute. Slowly add the
              milk, a little at a time, and whisk into the flour mixture until
              smooth. Simmer for a further minute, stirring continually, and
              season to taste.
            </p>

            <p>
              Place a layer of mince in the bottom of an ovenproof dish, then
              top with a layer of pasta and white sauce. Repeat until the dish
              is full, finishing with a layer of white sauce. Sprinkle over the
              Parmigiano Reggiano, paprika and breadcrumbs. Bake for 25–30
              minutes, or until golden.
            </p>

              Chef's note: “Lasagne is one of the best food gifts Italy has ever
              given the world. It’s my favourite pasta dish and this is a
              version of my Dad’s recipe that still honours its authenticity.”
